This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in R related to subsetting data frames using character vectors that contain `NA` values. The `bug.R` file shows the problematic code, which produces an unexpected empty data frame instead of the expected subset. The `bugSolution.R` file provides a solution to handle this situation correctly.  This scenario often goes unnoticed because it doesn't throw an error, instead producing a silent, incorrect result.
